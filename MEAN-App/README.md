NOTE : 
1. I have sent bcrypt module separately as it might cause trouble while installing.
2. While registering the new user, password must have atleast 1 special character, 1 uppercase character, 1 lowercase character and must be atleast 6 characters long.
2. Some of the stylized components like toast messages might not display properly as I was following a strict deadline and had to complete the functionlity part as much as possible. Most of the toast messages are being displayed on the bottom of the page without any styling.
