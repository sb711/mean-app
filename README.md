NOTE : 
1. While registering the new user, password must have atleast 1 special character, 1 uppercase character, 1 lowercase character and must be atleast 6 characters long.
2. I tried to complete all the requirements but there might be a few things which are not working as intended. I wanted to work according to the strict deadline but in the end managed to cover most of the things.
