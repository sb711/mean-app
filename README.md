MEAN Application Assignment

1. Create a new DB 'mean_project' using Studio 3T/RoboMongo.
2. Import the collections from folder 'mongoDB/mean_project'.
3. In the folder MEAN-App, 'npm install'.
4. After npm install, run 'ng build--prod'.
5. Finally, run 'npm run start:server'. 
6. http://localhost:3000

Node Version - 8.9.4
NOTE : 
1. I have sent bcrypt module separately as it might cause trouble while installing.
2. While registering the new user, password must have atleast 1 special character, 1 uppercase character, 1 lowercase character and must be atleast 6 characters long.
2. I tried to complete all the requirements but there might be a few things which are not working as intended. I wanted to work according to the strict deadline but in the end managed to cover most of the things.
